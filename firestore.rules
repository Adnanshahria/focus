/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-generated
 * data is stored in subcollections under that user's unique document ID (`/users/{userId}`).
 * This ensures that a user can only ever access their own data tree, providing strong
 * security and isolation by default.
 *
 * Data Structure: The database uses a hierarchical structure where all application data
 * (preferences, focus records, sessions) is nested under the `/users/{userId}` path. This
 * design makes authorization checks simple and highly performant.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: All access control is based on matching the authenticated user's
 *   UID (`request.auth.uid`) with the `{userId}` wildcard in the document path.
 * - No Public Data: There are no publicly readable collections. All data requires authentication.
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible to list all documents in the top-level `/users`
 *   collection, preventing enumeration of all application users.
 * - Authorization-Centric Validation: Data validation is intentionally minimal, focusing only
 *   on fields critical for maintaining ownership links and relational integrity (e.g., ensuring
 *   a `FocusRecord`'s internal `userId` matches the path). This supports rapid development
 *   while maintaining robust security.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The entire data model is built on this principle. By
 * nesting all data under a user-specific path, we avoid slow and costly `get()` or `exists()`
 * calls to other documents for authorization. The path itself contains all the necessary
 * information to make a security decision.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: User data is naturally segregated into separate subcollections
 * (e.g., `userPreferences`, `focusRecords`), which simplifies rules and improves query
 * performance for list operations.
